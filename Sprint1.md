### What issues your team planned to address
1. Setup Angular + Golang
2. Create starting menu (frontend)
3. Write Tic Tac Toe game script (backend)
4. Make Tic Tac Toe visuals (frontend)
5. Connect Tic Tac Toe script to front end
6. Write War game script (backend)
### Which ones were successfully completed
1. Setup Angular + Golang
2. Created some of the starting menu
3. Write Tic Tac Toe game script
4. Write War game script
### Which ones didn't and why?
Front end team was unable to create a full starting menu and Tic Tac Toe visuals because we ran into a lot of issues setting up the project, so issue (1) took up the majority of frontend work during sprint 1.

We were unable to conenct the Tic Tac Toe script to the front end because of the delays caused by the Angular + Golang setup. However, the back end team was able to make both a script for the Tic Tac Toe game and for the War game in Go.
